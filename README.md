# SimonSays

A little app based on a children's game called "SimonSays".
The idea of the game is to follow the order of the colors and remember the most colors in order possible.

The order of the colors continues infinitly.

The app counts the turns of the player and asks for his name later for the leaderboard.

The app is built using ReactNative, Redux, AsyncStorage and navigation.
